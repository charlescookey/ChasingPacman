## ChasingPacman
It's like the classic pacman game , but you play as the ghost(you'd be using tanks) and chase pacman and try to kill him before he gets all his coins

I intend to update the game and add more features. This is my first project after learning Unreal.

Feedback is greattly appreciated

You can download the game from [here](https://charles-cookey.itch.io/chasingpacman)

The game has single and multi player. You would need to have steam running in the background.
